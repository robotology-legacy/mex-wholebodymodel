The complete refactoring of the mexWholeBodyModel subroutine for Matlab has caused a lot of changes inside of the C++ code and also outside in the wrapper functions. During this process and the code-style unification, a lot of variable and function names were renamed with more meaningful names.

For the current projects and for all new projects, it is recommended to use the new wrapper-functions or the functions from the object-oriented WBM-classes!
