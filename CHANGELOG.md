## [Unreleased]
### Added
- All the functions take in input the complete state, including the base pose with respect to the world, 
  see [Issue 27](https://github.com/robotology/mex-wholebodymodel/issues/27).
- Please note that a bug occured before [Pull Request](https://github.com/robotology/mex-wholebodymodel/pull/57) that inverted
  the rotation passed (when passing the full state) to the `wbm_forwardKinematics`,`wbm_massMatrix`, `wbm_jacobian`, `wbm_centrodialMomentum`, `wbm_djdq`. 

### Removed
- Removed `wbm_setWorldLink`, its behavior can be emulated with the `wbm_getWorldFrameFromFixedLink` and the new interfaces that take the complete
  state as input. 
  See [Issue 43](https://github.com/robotology/mex-wholebodymodel/issues/43) and [Pull Request 52](https://github.com/robotology/mex-wholebodymodel/pull/52).
